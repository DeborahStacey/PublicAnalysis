Main GitHub: https://github.com/GuelphOntologyTeam

We made all our final copies on the PublicWebInterface Team so see info below!

*** Important ***

Also our current updated code is merged with the PublicWebInterface team:
https://github.com/GuelphOntologyTeam/PublicWebInterface

They did not put our code to their master branch, so you must change to *PublicAnalysis branch* when finding our code
through the PublicWebInterface team.

You can find our codebase located at: PublicWebInterface/src/components/pages/dashboard/PublicStats/PublicAnalysis
in the PublicAnalysis branch of the PublicWebInterface Team.

We only have this README.txt in our directory as our code is now implemented and working with the PublicWebInterface team with our own special branch
so we will direct you there following the info above.
